    "## PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "You are given 4 discrete waypoints from the previous section. Your task is to interpolate these points using cubic spline interpolation, but with a focus on optimizing the shape of the curve. Essentially, you are required to minimize the total curvature of the resulting spline by varying the second derivative values at the boundaries. This should be done without using inbuilt spline functions from libraries such as scipy. The goal is to find the smoothest possible path through the points, which would represent the ideal trajectory for a vehicle to follow. You may choose suitable bounds for the second derivative values and iterate through the different combinations of boundary conditions to determine the configuration that leads to the minimum total curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIONAL:\n",
    "You may notice that directly finding the smoothest curve through waypoints seems inefficient and computationally expensive. Fortunately, mathematicians have developed robust optimization techniques that are readily available through libraries like scipy.optimize.\n",
    "In this task, try enhancing the cubic interpolation curve you obtained earlier by finding an optimal trajectory through the waypoints — one that minimizes the curvature at every interpolated point.\n",
    "To do this, you can treat the second derivatives at the curve’s boundaries as variables to be optimized. Use scipy functions to perform this optimization and compare the resulting smooth curve to the original interpolation. ,However you may not  notice an appreciable reduction in sharpness and a smoother, more natural path. What else can be done then for the optimal raceline for our car?\n",
