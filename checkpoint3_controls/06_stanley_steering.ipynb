    "## What Is Stanley Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanley control is a geometric path tracking algorithm used for steering control in autonomous vehicles. It was developed by Stanford University’s team during the DARPA Grand Challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanley Control uses the front axle as the reference point and accounts for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heading error (ψ): the difference between the vehicle’s orientation and the path’s direction.\n",
    "- Cross-track error (e): the lateral distance from the front axle of the car to the closest point on the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to compute a steering angle δ(t) that aligns the car with the path over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (x, y): rear axle position of the vehicle  \n",
    "- ψ: Yaw error or heading error = θ - car_yaw\n",
    "- v: vehicle speed  \n",
    "- (xf, yf): front axle position = (x + L cos(ψ), y + L sin(ψ))  \n",
    "- θ: tangent (heading) of the path at the nearest point  \n",
    "\n",
    "The control law combines both error terms into the steering command:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\delta(t) = k_y \\psi(t) + \\tan^{-1}\\left( \\frac{k \\cdot e(t)}{v + k_s} \\right)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- k is a gain parameter for how strongly the cross-track error is corrected.  \n",
    "- kₛ is a small softening constant to prevent division by zero when speed is low.  \n",
    "- δ(t) is clipped between steering angle limits.\n",
    "- k_y is the weight of yaw error which can be useful for tuning the controller\n",
    "\n",

    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Stanley steering function using the signature below. You will import this function in your animation simulator notebook."
