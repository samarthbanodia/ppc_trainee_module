    "# Full Animation: PID Throttle Control and Stanley Steering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be developing a complete animation of an autonomous car that utilizes **PID control** for throttle and **Stanley control** for steering. You'll implement the missing pieces of the code and adjust parameters to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically we are gonna combine everything learnt till now to create a full working animation of how the car will run on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by getting cone positions, we then got waypoints and interpolated them. We then optimised them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the optimised path, we will use our knowledge of PID control and Stanley steering to race the car on the track!\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple point mass model has been implemented as the car for initial testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. Implement **PID throttle control** to maintain a desired speed.\n",
    "2. Implement **Stanley steering** to follow a predefined path.\n",
    "3. Tune the Stanley controller to achieve better path tracking.\n",
    "4. Visualize the system's behavior using an animation.\n",
