    "# 🚗 Path Planning – Interpolating Discrete Points\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the actual task of **planning a path** begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, we rarely have access to a **continuous set of paths**.  \n",
    "Instead, we deal with a **limited number of discrete points**, such as waypoints from cone detections or sensor outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to **connect these discrete points** and generate a smooth and feasible trajectory that the vehicle can follow.\n",

    "## Why Do We Need Interpolation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we cannot drive through isolated points, we must **\"connect the dots\"** to create a **continuous path**.  \n",
    "There are different methods for this, and choosing the right one depends on the trade-offs between:\n",
    "- Accuracy\n",
    "- Smoothness\n",
    "- Computation time\n",
    "- Real-time feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to **explore** these topics online and understand them deeply.  \n",
    "Your final goal is to **optimize the path**, so analyze each method’s **advantages and disadvantages**.\n",
