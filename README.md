# **IITB Racing Autonomous: Path Planning & Controls Trainee Module**
---

## üèéÔ∏è Who We Are

We are the Path Planning and Controls Subsystem (PPC) of **IITB Racing Driverless**, a student-led team that builds autonomous electric race cars.

Our goal is to enable our car to **race autonomously between blue and yellow cones**, **complete a lap in the shortest possible time**, and **avoid collisions with any cones**. To achieve this, we focus on designing algorithms that generate **optimal paths** and provide **precise controls** to follow them.

### What We‚Äôve Achieved So Far
- **Delaunay Triangulation** for fast and smooth raceline generation  
- **Optimized racelines** to reduce lap time  
- **PID**, **Pure Pursuit** and **Stanley Controllers** for tracking paths  
- **Velocity profiling** based on curvature  

### üî¨ What We‚Äôre Currently Working On
- **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees)** for real-time path planning in unknown maps  
- **MPC (Model Predictive Control)** for generating optimal control actions considering dynamics

## Introduction to Path Planning and Control

**Path Planning and Control** is a critical subsystem that connects high-level perception with low-level actuation. It ensures that the autonomous race car not only knows **where to go** but also **how to get there** effectively and safely.

### üìå Path Planning:
Generates a feasible and smooth trajectory based on the car‚Äôs position and the SLAM-generated map. We explore:
- Linear & spline interpolation  
- Delaunay triangulation  
- Curvature-based optimization  
- Algorithms like A*, RRT, and optimization-based planners  

### üìå Controls:
Makes sure the car follows the planned trajectory by computing steering, throttle, and brake commands. We cover:
- PID controllers for speed tracking  
- Pure Pursuit and Stanley for steering  
- Advanced controllers like MPC that take vehicle dynamics into account  

Together, they allow our autonomous race car to drive dynamically and intelligently!
